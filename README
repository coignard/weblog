Weblog
======

A minimalistic, plain text-based blog engine written in PHP, inspired by
the simplicity and structure of the RFC format.  No HTML, CSS, or JS
included.  The blog engine does not require a database to function.

I created this project to run my personal weblog, so you can check out the
project in action on my personal website:
